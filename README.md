**400 working solutions for every ARC task.**

These solutions are prepared for the [Google Code Golf 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/google-code-golf-2025/overview) competition.


## Credits & Sources

This dataset builds upon solutions developed using the official ARC data:

- **Original ARC Dataset**: [Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus](https://www.kaggle.com/c/abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge/data)
- **Task definitions**: Based on the Google Code Golf 2025 competition tasks

After solutions were taken from there, the remaining ~100 were generated automatically: [Abstraction Refinement](https://x.com/ccrisccris/status/1967432164024189413)


## Usage

```python
from task001 import p
result = p(your_input_grid)
```

## What's Here

- `task001.py` to `task400.py` - Complete solutions for all ARC tasks

Each file contains one working solution with a function named `p`.
