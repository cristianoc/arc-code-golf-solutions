# ARC Solutions via Abstraction Refinement

**400 working solutions for every ARC task.**

ðŸ”— **Generated using [Abstraction Refinement](https://x.com/ccrisccris/status/1967432164024189413)**

These solutions are prepared for the [Google Code Golf 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/google-code-golf-2025/overview) competition.

**Auto-generated Solutions (~100 tasks):**
The remaining solutions were automatically generated by refinement starting from Michael Hodel's arc-dsl solutions.
- Arc-DSL approach for systematic ARC problem solving

**Built upon:**
- [Original ARC Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge/data) - Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus by FranÃ§ois Chollet
- [Google Code Golf 2025 Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/google-code-golf-2025/overview)

## Usage

```python
from task001 import p
result = p(your_input_grid)
```

## What's Here
